# Klipper plugin for a self calibrating Z offset


You use this on your onw risk! I'm not responsible for any damage this could lead to. Although,
this extension works rock solid for me and many more for almost a year now. Be always carefully
and double check everything while configuring or working with your printer. Do never leave it
unattended during prints!
