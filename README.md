# Klipper plugin for a self calibrating Z offset


You use this on your onw risk! I'm not responsible for any damage this could lead to. Although,
this extension works rock solid for me and many more for almost a year now. Be always carefully
and double check everything while configuring or working with your printer. Do never leave it
unattended during prints!

Requirements
A Z endstop where the tip of the nozzle drives on a switch (like the standard Voron V1/V2 enstop). It will not work with the virtual pin of the probe as endstop! It is not essential to have a Voron printer for this - but this kind of endstop.
A magnetic switch based probe at the print head - instead of the stock inductive probe (e.g. this ones from Annex, or the popular drop in replacement KlickyProbe with many mounting options)
Both, the Z endstop and mag-probe are configured properly and homing and QGL are working.
The "z_calibration.py" file needs to be copied to the klipper/klippy/extras folder. Klipper will then load this file if it finds the "[z_calibration]" configuration section. It does not interfere with the Moonraker's Klipper update since git ignores unknown files.
It's good practice to use the probe switch as normally closed. Then, macros can detect if the probe is attached/released properly. The plugin is also able to detect that the mag-probe is attached to the print head - otherwise it will stop!
‚òùÔ∏è Note: After copying the pyhton script, a full Klipper service restart is needed to load it!

Example
The output of the calibration with all determined positions looks like this (the offset is the one which is applied as GCode offset):

Z-CALIBRATION: ENDSTOP=-0.300 NOZZLE=-0.300 SWITCH=6.208 PROBE=7.013 --> OFFSET=-0.170
The endstop value is the homed Z position which is always zero or the configure "stepper_z:position_endstop" setting - and in this case, it's even the same as the probed nozzle hight.

How To Install It
To install this plugin, you need to copy the z_calibration.py file into the extras folder of klipper. Like:

/home/pi/klipper/klippy/extras/z_calibration.py
An alternative would be to clone this repo and run the install.sh script. Like:

cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration.git
./klipper_z_calibration/install.sh
It's safe to execute the install script multiple times.

How To Configure It
Preconditions
As a precondition, the probe needs to be configured properly. It must work flawlessly! If you don't know how, please have a look at the KlickyProbe and how to configure it! There is also a very good but complex example configuration from zellneralex.

Now, if the probe works reliably, Then this auto Z offset calibration is basically configured by adding the z_calibration section. All possible properties and it's default values are documented here under configurations.

A minimal start configuration could look like this:

[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position:   <X,Y position for clicking the nozzle on the Z endstop>
switch_xy_position:   <X,Y position for clicking the probe's switch body on the Z endstop>
bed_xy_position:      <X,Y position for probing the bed, for instance the center point>
switch_offset:        <offset of the switch trigger (read the Switch Offset section!)>
start_gcode:          <macro name for attaching the probe>
#before_switch_gcode: <macro name for attaching the probe AFTER probing the nozzle>
end_gcode:            <macro name for docking the probe>
It is good practice to use more than one sample and use "median" as "probe:samples_result". And it's important to configure an appropriate probe offset in X, Y and Z. The Z offset does not need to be an exact value, since we do not use it as an offset, but it needs to be roughly a real value!

It even doesn't matter what "stepper_z:position_endstop" value is configured in Klipper. All positions are relative to this point - only the absolute values are different. But, it's advisable to configure a safe value here to not crash the nozzle into the build plate by accident. The plugin only changes the GCode offset and it's still possible to move the nozzle beyond this offset.

Configurations
üí° NEW: The X and Y coordinates are now combined into one option with a "X,Y" value.

The following configuration is needed to activate the plugin and to set some needed values:

[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.
switch_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the Z endstop.
bed_xy_position: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#   a X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the relative
#   reference index at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset:
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   Larger values will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This needs to be find out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 1.0
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
samples: default from "probe:samples" section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 50
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
üí° INFO: The settings about probing from this section do not apply to the probing on the bed, since the script just calls the probe to do it's job at this point. Only the first fast down probing is covered by this script directly.

Bed Mesh
üí° NEW: Adaptive mesh macros can be used now by redefining the RRI of the mesh and/or by using the new "BED_POSITION" parameter of the "CALIBRATE_Z" command.

If you use a bed mesh, it is advised to configure it with a relative reference index ("bed_mesh:relative_reference_index" setting). But this is not enforced anymore. With a configured relative reference, the position at this index will become the Z=0 point of the mesh. So, it's good to calibrate Z at this point. If the configuration lacks a "bed_xy_position", then the relative reference index will be read every time the calibration is started. Thereby it's possible to change this index by a macro at runtime.

This is used by adaptive mesh macros. They create a smaller mesh which is only on the area used by the starting print. One example would be the macros from Frix-x which can be found here.

‚òùÔ∏è NOTE: Be careful with adaptive mesh macros because they use Klipper's mesh function in an unsupported way! It's important to calibrate Z correctly for the created mesh!

Switch Offset
The "z_calibration:switch_offset" is the already mentioned offset from the switch body (which is the probed position) to the actual trigger point above it. A starting point for this value can be taken from the data sheet of the Omron switch (D2F-5: 0.5mm and SSG-5H: 0.7mm). It's safe to start with a little less depending on the squishiness you prefer for the first layer (for me, it's about 0.46 for the D2F-5). So, with a smaller offset value, the nozzle is more away from the bed! The value cannot be negative.

For example, the data sheet of the D2F-5:

endstop offset

And the calculation of the offset base:

offset base = OP (Operation Position) - switch body height
     0.5 mm = 5.5 mm - 5 mm
How About A Negative Switch Offset?
First of all, there cannot be a negative switch_offset! If the switch_offset is already really small after tuning it and the nozzle is still too close to the bed, then there is something wrong measuring the probe's body. The following image illustrates this context:

switch offset

So, please check your endstop, the rod of the endstop and the position touching the body of the probe's switch!

‚ùó Please, do NOT drive the endstop pin on the switch's actuator directly! Otherwise, you do it on your own risk and I will reject any request for support!

If you do so, a correct or at least a working measured hight at the switch is all up to the different forces in this system. But forces can change due to many reasons. The best case would be that the actuator is pushed all the way in until the pin touches the body of the switch - before the endstop is triggered! But it can also be anything in between... So, there is no reason to not touch the body directly in a safe and robust way üëç

How To Test It
Do not bother too much about absolute values of the calculated offsets. These can vary a lot. Only the real position from the nozzle to the bed counts. To test this, the result of the calibration can be queried by GET_POSITION first:

> CALIBRATE_Z
> Z-CALIBRATION: ENDSTOP=-0.300 NOZZLE=-0.267 SWITCH=2.370 PROBE=3.093 --> OFFSET=-0.010000
> GET_POSITION
> mcu: stepper_x:17085 stepper_y:15625 stepper_z:-51454 stepper_z1:-51454 stepper_z2:-51454 stepper_z3:-51454
> stepper: stepper_x:552.500000 stepper_y:-47.500000 stepper_z:10.022500 stepper_z1:10.022500 stepper_z2:10.022500 stepper_z3:10.022500
> kinematic: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:10.022500
> toolhead: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:10.021472 E:0.000000
> gcode: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:9.990000 E:0.000000
> gcode base: X:0.000000 Y:0.000000 Z:-0.010000 E:0.000000
> gcode homing: X:0.000000 Y:0.000000 Z:-0.010000
Here, the Z position in "gcode base" reflects the calibrated Z offset.

Then, the offset can be tested by moving the nozzle slowly down to zero by moving it in multiple steps. It's good to do this by using GCodes, since the offset is applied as GCode-Offset. For example like this:

> G90
> G0 Z5
> G0 Z3
> G0 Z1
> G0 Z0.5
> G0 Z0.3
> G0 Z0.1
Check the distance to the print surface after every step. If there is a small discrepancy (which should be smaller than the offset base from the switch's data sheet), then adapt the "z_calibration:switch_offset" by that value. Decreasing the "switch_offset" will move the nozzle more away from the bed.

And finally, if you have double checked, that the calibrated offset is correct, you can go for fine tuning the "z_calibration:switch_offset" by actually printing first layer tests.

How To Use It
‚òùÔ∏è NOTE: If you calibrate Z within a SAVE_GCODE_STATE and RESTORE_GCODE_STATE, the calibrated offset will be lost after calling RESTORE_GCODE_STATE!

Command CALIBRATE_Z
üí° NEW: The configured position for probing on the bed can now be overwritten by using the new "BED_POSITION" parameter.

The Z offset calibration is started by:

CALIBRATE_Z [BED_POSITION=<X mm, Y mm>]
The optional "BED_POSITION" parameter can be used to define a different position to be probed on the bed. But, if the "bed_xy_position" is not configured and there is no bed mesh or relative reference index, this parameter becomes mandatory.

The "BED_POSITION" argument overrules any configured bed position.

If the probe is not attached to the print head, it will abort the calibration process (if configured normally closed). So, macros can help here to attach and detach the probe like this:

[gcode_macro CALIBRATE_Z]
rename_existing: BASE_CALIBRATE_Z
gcode:
    {% set bed_position = params.BED_POSITION|default('None') %}
    G28                         # can also be a conditional homing macro
    M117 Z-Calibration..
    ATTACH_PROBE                # a macro for fetching the probe first
    {% if bed_position != 'None' %}
      BASE_CALIBRATE_Z BED_POSITION={bed_position}
    {% else %}
      BASE_CALIBRATE_Z
    {% endif %}
    DETACH_PROBE                # and parking it afterwards (or DOCK_PROBE in klicky macros)
    M117
üí° INFO: Meanwhile, it's possible to use the "start_gcode" or "before_switch_gcode" and the "end_gcode" instead of rewriting the CALIBRATE_Z command!

Then the CALIBRATE_Z command needs to be added to the PRINT_START macro.

‚ùó And remove any Z offset adjustments here (like SET_GCODE_OFFSET) ‚ùó

The print start sequence could look like this:

Home all axes
Heat up the bed and nozzle (and chamber)
Get probe, make QGL or Z-Tilt, park probe
Purge and clean the nozzle if available
(Get probe), CALIBRATE_Z, (park probe)
(Adjust Z offset if needed)
Print intro line
Start printing...
For textured print plates it can be necessary to adjust the offset to be more close to the bed. This can be done from the Slicers start GCode by adding a parameter to the PRINT_START macro after the Z calibration:

# Adjust the G-Code Z offset if needed
SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z_ADJUST={params.Z_ADJUST|default(0.0)|float} MOVE=1
Then, you can use PRINT_START Z_ADJUST=0.0 in your Slicer. This does not reset the offset set by the calibration but adjusts it by the given value!

‚òùÔ∏è NOTE: Do not home Z again after running this calibration or it needs to be executed again!

Now, I wish you happy printing with an always perfect first layer - doesn't matter what you just modded on your printer's head or bed or what nozzle and flex plate you like to use for your next project. It's just perfect üòÉ

Resetting the Calibration
The calibration can be resetted by executing this GCode command:

SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=0.0
Command PROBE_Z_ACCURACY
There is also a PROBE_Z_ACCURACY command to test the accuracy of the Z endstop:

PROBE_Z_ACCURACY [PROBE_SPEED=<mm/s>] [LIFT_SPEED=<mm/s>] [SAMPLES=<count>] [SAMPLE_RETRACT_DIST=<mm>]
It calculates the maximum, minimum, average, median and standard deviation of multiple probe samples on the endstop by taking the configured nozzle position on the endstop. The optional parameters default to their equivalent setting in the z_calibration config section.

Ooze Mitigation
Ooze with any nozzle probe endstop can cause inaccuracies, as the filament will continue to leak or deform over the space of multiple probes. It is highly recommended to take some measures to prevent ooze buildup before the nozzle probe portion of this plugin.

A slow long retraction, of as much as 15mm at print end, can reduce the potential for ooze. If you do this, consider adding a comparable extrude as the last command in your print start sequence to bring the plastic back to the tip. (Retracts longer than 5mm have been linked to clogs in many hotends, especially the Rapido. This may be best considered a last resort, depending on exact hardware and filament.)

Heating the nozzle about a minute before scrubbing - using a purge bucket - will allow all the remaining plastic time to drain from the nozzle and be cleaned away by a simple wipe. If using a purge and scrubbing bucket, do not purge filament at this stage.

An endstop switch that requires a stronger activation force, such as sexbolt with a spring, or unklicky z, can help squash any remaining ooze and improve consistency.

Probing can be done with a hotend temperature below the full temperature for the print. If you print at 250, you can preheat the nozzle to 180, and run this script before finishing the heat up to full temperature. This may have varying effects depending on temperatures used.

Also consider picking up your probe prior to your nozzle wipe, to allow this script to probe the nozzle immediately after cleaning it.
